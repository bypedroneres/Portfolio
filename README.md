<h3>✺ Portfolio Website ✺</h3>

The HTML + CSS Portfolio Project is a personal website created to showcase the work and skills of a developer. It serves as an online platform for the developer to display their projects, share information about themselves, and provide links to their social media profiles.

<h4>✹ Goal ✹</h4>

The main goal of creating this portfolio website is to establish a professional online presence and demonstrate the developer's abilities and accomplishments. By showcasing their work, the developer aims to attract potential clients, employers, or collaborators who are interested in their expertise and would like to explore their projects further.

The portfolio website features a sleek design with a black background, symbolizing the coding environment. The choice of the Roboto Mono font adds to the coding aesthetic, reinforcing the idea of the developer's technical skills. The minimalist and clean design allows the focus to remain on the showcased projects and the developer's information.
