<h3>✺ My Portfolio Website ✺</h3>
The HTML + CSS Portfolio Project is my personal website created to showcase my work and skills as a developer. It serves as an online platform for me to display my projects, share information about myself, and provide links to my social media profiles.

<h4>✹ My Goal ✹</h4>
The main goal of creating this portfolio website is to establish my professional online presence and demonstrate my abilities and accomplishments. By showcasing my work, I aim to attract potential clients, employers, or collaborators who are interested in my expertise and would like to explore my projects further.

<h4>✹ Design ✹</h4>
My portfolio website features a sleek design with a black background, symbolizing the coding environment. I chose the Roboto Mono font to add to the coding aesthetic, reinforcing the idea of my technical skills. The minimalist and clean design allows the focus to remain on my showcased projects and my information.

<h4>✹ Features ✹</h4>
<b>Social Media Icons:</b> I have included social media icons that provide links to my profiles on platforms such as Behance and GitHub. This allows visitors to easily connect with me and explore my additional work or contributions.
<b>Recent Project Button:</b> A button with hover functionality enables visitors to view my most recent project. This feature highlights my current focus and ongoing development, creating a sense of dynamism and progression.
<h4>✹ What I've Learned ✹</h4>
<b>Design Principles:</b> This project has allowed me to apply fundamental design principles, such as color scheme selection, typography, and layout composition. These principles contribute to creating an aesthetically pleasing and visually coherent website.
<b>Code Usability:</b> By implementing HTML and CSS, I have gained experience in writing clean and organized code that is easy to maintain and modify. Understanding best practices for code organization and readability enhances the overall quality of my website.
<b>Nesting:</b> By utilizing proper HTML and CSS nesting techniques, I have learned how to structure and style the elements of my website efficiently. This approach improves code readability and reduces the likelihood of conflicts or errors.
